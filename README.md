Overview: Dataset overview, Dataset Cleaning & Featuring 
We are working on the dataset that we previously cleaned, and feature engineered.

PART 1: Fitting the models 

The models have been fitted to the dataset (see code), and their performance has been evaluated. Here are the results:

1.	Linear Regression Model Overview:
Results:
•	R2 Score: 0.9906
This indicates a very high level of fit for the model to the data. An R2 score close to 1 suggests that the model explains most of the variability in the response variable.
•	MSE (Mean Squared Error): 0.3817
This value represents the average squared difference between the observed actual outturns and the values predicted by the model. A lower MSE indicates a better fit.
•	RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 0.6178
RMSE is the square root of the mean squared error, which shows how much the predictions deviate from the actual values in the same units as the response variable.
•	MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 0.4447
This shows the average magnitude of errors in the set of predictions, without considering their direction. A lower MAE indicates better prediction accuracy.

Interpretation:
•	The high R2 score implies that the Linear Regression model is quite effective in predicting the apparent temperature based on the given features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
•	The relatively low values of MSE, RMSE, and MAE suggest that the model's predictions are close to the actual data points, indicating good accuracy.
•	Since Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, the effectiveness of the model implies that the relationship between the predictors (like temperature, humidity, etc.) and the apparent temperature is mostly linear in nature.
•	The model is likely to perform well for predictions within the range of the dataset but may not capture potential non-linear relationships as effectively as more complex models.

2.	Decision Tree Regression Model Overview:
Results:
•	R2 Score: 0.9984
The model has a very high R2 score, indicating that it can explain about 99.84% of the variance in the target variable, 'Apparent Temperature'.
•	MSE (Mean Squared Error): 0.0665
A lower MSE value suggests that the model's predictions are close to the actual data points.
•	RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 0.2578
RMSE provides the standard deviation of the residuals, indicating how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit. Lower RMSE values are better.
•	MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 0.0902
Indicates the average magnitude of errors in the set of predictions, without considering their direction. Lower MAE values indicate more accurate predictions.

Interpretation:
•	The high R2 score combined with low MSE, RMSE, and MAE values indicates that the Decision Tree model performs exceptionally well in predicting the apparent temperature from the given features.
•	The optimal hyperparameters suggest a relatively shallow tree depth (10) which helps in preventing overfitting while still capturing the essential patterns in the data.
•	The Decision Tree model's strong performance might be attributed to its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data and capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.

3.	Gradient Boosting Regressor Model Overview:
The results from the Gradient Boosting Regressor Model indicate a highly effective model for predicting the apparent temperature from the dataset. Let's interpret each aspect of the results:

Results:
•	R2 Score: 0.9993
The R2 score is very close to 1, which is excellent. It means the model can explain about 99.93% of the variance in the target variable. This high R2 score indicates a very accurate model.
•	RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 0.1626
RMSE measures the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). A lower RMSE is better, and 0.1626 indicates that the model’s predictions are, on average, within 0.1626 units of the actual values. Considering the scale of your target variable, this is a good result.
•	MSE (Mean Squared Error): 0.0264
MSE is the average of the squares of the errors. The low MSE of 0.0264 further confirms the model's accuracy and its ability to minimize error across predictions.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 0.0599
•	MAE provides an average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values. A MAE of 0.0599, being low, indicates high accuracy of the model, with an average error of about 0.0599 units in its predictions.

Interpretation:
•	The combination of these hyperparameters and the resulting performance metrics indicates a highly accurate and robust model.
•	The model is particularly effective in predicting the apparent temperature based on the features provided.
•	Its ability to capture complex relationships in the data without overfitting is evident from the high R2 score and low error metrics (RMSE, MSE, MAE).
•	This model would be very reliable for making predictions within the scope of the provided dataset.

4.	Neural Network Model Overview:
Results:
•	MSE (Mean Squared Error): 0.1531
MSE measures the average of the squares of the prediction errors. A value of 0.1531 indicates that on average, the squared difference between the predicted values and actual values is 0.1531. It's a measure of the quality of the estimator—it is always non-negative, and values closer to zero are better.
•	RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 0.3913
RMSE is the square root of the MSE and provides a measure of the magnitude of the error. An RMSE of 0.3913 indicates that the model’s predictions are, on average, within 0.3913 units of the actual values. Considering the scale of your target variable, this RMSE can be considered as indicating good predictive accuracy.
•	MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 0.3009
MAE gives an idea of how big of an error you can expect from the forecast on average. A MAE of 0.3009 suggests that the average magnitude of errors in the set of predictions is around 0.3009 units.

Interpretation:
•	The results indicate that the Neural Network model performs quite well in predicting the apparent temperature, although there is some room for improvement.
•	The MSE and RMSE values are low, suggesting that the model's predictions are generally close to the actual values.
•	The MAE being 0.3009 implies that the average error in predictions is manageable and not too far off from the actual values.
•	The chosen hyperparameters seem to provide a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

a.	To implement a pipeline for the provided dataset and the models discussed (Linear Regression, Regression Tree, Boosted Regression Tree, and a basic Feed Forward Neural Network), we'll need to define and justify the choice of hyperparameters for each model. Below is a table listing the hyperparameters for each model along with justifications based on current heuristics and established trends observed in the literature:
Model	Hyperparameters	Justification
Linear Regression	N/A (Linear Regression doesn't have hyperparameters like the other models)	Linear Regression is a straightforward model with no hyperparameters for tuning. Its simplicity is one of its strengths, as it provides a baseline against which more complex models can be compared.
Neural Network	Learning Rate, Epochs, Batch Size	• Learning Rate: Governs the step size during training, impacting how quickly the model learns without overshooting or converging too slowly.
•Epochs: Dictates how many times the model goes through the entire dataset, balancing between underfitting and overfitting by finding the sweet spot for model learning.
•Batch Size: Determines the number of samples processed together, affecting training speed and the quality of gradient estimates for parameter updates.
Decision Tree Regression	Max Depth, Min Samples Leaf, Min Samples Split	•Max Depth: Controls tree complexity to avoid overfitting by limiting the number of splits.
•Min Samples Leaf: Sets the minimum samples required at a leaf node, preventing nodes with too few samples.
•Min Samples Split: Specifies the minimum samples for a node to split, managing tree complexity and overfitting by limiting node creation.
Gradient Boosting Regressor	Learning Rate, Max Depth, Number of Estimators	•Learning Rate: Controls the impact of each tree's prediction, preventing overfitting and enhancing gradual learning.
•Max Depth: Manages individual tree complexity, preventing overfitting by limiting tree depth.
•Number of Estimators: Increases model performance by aggregating predictions from multiple trees, enhancing predictive power.


Justification:
•	Neural Networks: The chosen hyperparameters for the neural network align with common practices in deep learning. As per literature, the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size are crucial for the convergence and performance of neural networks. The architecture (number of layers and neurons) depends on the complexity of the task and the amount of data available.

•	Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting: For tree-based models, hyperparameters like max depth, min samples split, and min samples leaf are critical to control the complexity of the model. The decision on these parameters typically balances between the model's ability to fit the data well (depth and number of estimators) and avoiding overfitting (min samples for splitting and leaf). The learning rate in gradient boosting is particularly important as it dictates how quickly the model adapts to the 'error' in previous trees.

The hyperparameters for each model are chosen to optimize performance while avoiding common pitfalls like overfitting or underfitting. They are also reflective of established trends and heuristics in the machine learning community for similar types of data and tasks.

b.	Repeated k-Fold Cross-Validation with Hyperparameter Tuning (See code in Colab):
Grid Search with Cross-Validation appears to have been used for both the Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting Regressor models. This is an approach for identifying a suitable set of hyperparameters.

Process:

•	Repeated k-Fold Cross-Validation: This technique involves dividing the dataset into 'k' folds (or subsets) and repeatedly training the model 'k' times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining as the training set. Repeating this process multiple times provides a more robust estimate of model performance.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search): This method systematically goes through multiple combinations of parameter options, determining which combination gives the best results for the model. It's thorough but computationally expensive.
•	Standard Deviation of Averaged Scores: When choosing the best hyperparameters, it's crucial to consider not just the mean performance across folds but also the standard deviation. A lower standard deviation indicates more consistent performance across different subsets of the data, which is desirable. It's important because a model performing well on average but with high variability might not be reliable.

The results of best hyperparameters for each model are:

1.	Neural Network Hyperparameters:
•	Learning Rate: 0.001
This is a relatively low learning rate, which suggests that the model makes smaller adjustments to the weights during training. This can lead to more precise convergence but might require more epochs for the model to learn effectively.
•	Epochs: 100
This is a moderate number of epochs. It suggests that the model had a decent amount of iterations over the entire dataset to learn and adjust its weights.
•	Batch Size: 16
A smaller batch size like 16 allows the model to update its weights more frequently, which can lead to a more fine-tuned learning process. However, it can also increase the training time.

2.	Gradient Boosting Regressor Hyperparameters:
•	Learning Rate: 0.1
This is the rate at which the model learns. A learning rate of 0.1 is relatively fast, suggesting that the model quickly adjusts its weights to minimize error. It's a good balance between speed and the risk of overshooting the minimum error.
•	Max Depth: 5
This depth indicates the maximum levels the individual trees in the model can have. A depth of 5 allows the model to capture complex patterns in the data while still being shallow enough to avoid overfitting.
•	Number of Estimators: 200
This refers to the number of trees in the forest. A higher number like 200 suggests that the model uses a considerable number of trees to make predictions, improving accuracy but also increasing computational load.

3.	Decision Tree Best Hyperparameters:
•	Max Depth: 10
The maximum depth of the tree refers to the maximum length of the path from the root node to any leaf node. A max depth of 10 indicates that the tree can have up to 10 levels. This depth is sufficient to allow the model to capture complex patterns in the data but is not so deep that it risks overfitting. It strikes a balance between model complexity and generalization ability.
•	Min Samples Leaf: 2
This parameter specifies the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A minimum of 2 samples per leaf ensures that the tree doesn't create too many rules that apply to very few instances, which is another measure to prevent overfitting. It helps the tree to make decisions that are based on a reasonable number of data points, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.
•	Min Samples Split: 2
This hyperparameter defines the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. A value of 2 indicates that at least two samples are needed to further split a node, which again helps in preventing overfitting. It ensures that splits are made on nodes that have enough data to validate the decision made by the split.

c.	Performance Metric for Hyperparameter Search:
The choice of performance metric for hyperparameter search should align with the model's goal and the specific characteristics of the dataset. In our case, the results show metrics like R2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE.

Choosing the Metric: The choice depends on the specific requirements of the task:

•	MSE (Mean Squared Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) are commonly used for regression tasks. They penalize larger errors more severely, which is useful if such errors are particularly undesirable in your context.
•	MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is more robust to outliers than MSE/RMSE. It could be preferred if the goal is to minimize the average error magnitude without overly penalizing larger errors.
•	R2 Score measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A high R2 score indicates a good fit of the model to the data.

Justification:

•	In the context of weather prediction (like apparent temperature), MSE or RMSE might be more suitable if large prediction errors are particularly problematic (e.g., in critical applications where high accuracy is essential).
•	If the prediction task is more tolerant of occasional large errors, or if the dataset contains outliers, MAE might be a better choice.
•	R2 is useful for a high-level understanding of model fit but doesn't always reflect prediction accuracy on an individual level.
•	If accurate and consistent predictions are crucial and large errors are particularly costly, then optimizing for MSE or RMSE during hyperparameter tuning would be appropriate. On the other hand, if we are looking for general accuracy without being overly sensitive to occasional large errors, MAE might be a better choice.
•	Overall, we used all the metrics just to be on the safe side and not miss any crucial details of our study over the dataset.

d.	Ensuring that there is no data leakage in the pipeline when building machine learning models is crucial for the validity and generalizability of the results. Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates. Here are the key steps taken to avoid data leakage in the models we’ve implemented:
1. Separation of Training and Test Data:
Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training and testing sets before any preprocessing or modeling steps were conducted. This ensures that the model evaluation is done on data that the model has never seen during training, providing a more realistic estimate of its performance in real-world scenarios.
2. Preprocessing within Cross-Validation Loop:
Pipeline Integration: For models like Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting, preprocessing steps (like scaling and encoding) were integrated into a pipeline. This is crucial because it ensures that these preprocessing steps are fitted only on the training data within each fold of the cross-validation process. It prevents information from the validation fold (part of the training process in cross-validation) from leaking into the model training.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning Post-Split:
GridSearchCV: The hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV was performed after the data split. This avoids the risk of the hyperparameter tuning process having access to the test data. GridSearchCV uses only the training data and performs its internal cross-validation to prevent leakage.
4. Careful Feature Engineering:
Feature Selection: This step was done in the previous assignment where we carefully cleaned and engineered our dataset.
5. Use of Cross-Validation:
Repeated k-Fold Cross-Validation: This method was suggested for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring that the model's performance is evaluated on different subsets of the training data, thereby providing a more robust estimate of its performance, and avoiding overfitting.
Conclusion:
By following these best practices, the risk of data leakage was minimized, ensuring that the models' performance metrics are reliable and representative of their true predictive power. The separation of data, careful preprocessing, and mindful hyperparameter tuning are key to preserving the integrity of the modeling process.


PART 2: Comments and Interpretations
1.	Linear Regression Model Interpretation: 

a. Coefficient of Determination (R2 Score):
•	Result: 0.9906
•	Interpretation: The R2 score is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. An R2 score of 0.9906 means that approximately 99.06% of the variation in the 'Apparent Temperature' can be explained by the independent variables in the model. This indicates a very high level of fit and suggests that the model does an excellent job at predicting the target variable.

b. RMSE and its Percentage of the Target Variable's Average:
•	Result: RMSE = 0.6178
•	Process to Determine Percentage:
Calculate the average (mean) of the target variable (Apparent Temperature).
Compute what percentage RMSE is of this average.
•	Interpreting the Target Variable's Distribution:
The visualization result shows that the RMSE is approximately 3.92% of the target variable's average. This low percentage indicates that the model's predictions are quite close to the actual values on average, which is indicative of good predictive performance.

c. Scatter Plots (Real vs. Predicted Values) and Slope Analysis:
The scatter plot displays a strong linear relationship between actual and predicted values, with the points closely clustered around the identity line where the actual values equal the predicted values. The red line, which represents the best fit line through the data, is almost a 45-degree angle, suggesting that the model has high predictive accuracy across the range of values. There is no obvious pattern of residuals, which implies that the model does not consistently overestimate or underestimate across the spectrum of predictions.

d. Pearson’s Correlation between Real and Predicted:
It can be inferred from the scatter plot that the correlation would be very high, likely close to 1. This would indicate a strong positive linear relationship between the actual and predicted values, confirming the model's effectiveness.

e. Learning Curves and Analysis of Bias/Variance:
The second visual presents the learning curves for the model. The training score and the cross-validation score converge as the number of training examples increases, which suggests that adding more data would not significantly improve the model's performance. The shaded areas represent the variance of the scores.

2.	Neural Network Model Interpretation:

a. Coefficient of Determination (R2 Score):
An R² value of 0.997 for the neural network model indicates a nearly perfect fit, with the model explaining roughly 99.71% of the variance in apparent temperature. This level of accuracy is exceptional for most applications. However, such a high R² also warrants a check for overfitting to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.

b. RMSE and its Percentage of the Target Variable's Average:
The RMSE is 0.323, and we can see from the first plot that it RMSE constitutes approximately 2.05% of the target variable's average, indicating a high level of accuracy, especially given that the apparent temperature doesn't require highly precise predictions. This level of error is acceptable for general predictions where a slight deviation from the actual temperature is unlikely to have significant consequences.

c. Scatter Plots (Real vs. Predicted Values) and Slope Analysis:
The scatter plot with a slope close to 1 suggests a strong linear relationship between the predicted and actual values of apparent temperature. In practical terms, this indicates that the model performs consistently across the range of temperatures, and the minor deviations are not a major concern for the applications at hand.

d. Pearson’s Correlation between Real and Predicted:
The Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 1.00 suggests a perfect linear relationship, though this value is likely rounded, and the true correlation is slightly less than perfect. However, for the purposes of predicting apparent temperature, this level of correlation is indicative of a very reliable model.

e. Learning Curves and Analysis of Bias/Variance:
The learning curves show that the model has quickly learned the pattern and stabilized, which is ideal for predicting apparent temperature. The absence of overfitting or underfitting suggests:

•	Bias: Low bias is beneficial because it means the model has sufficiently captured the relationship between the inputs and the target variable.
•	Variance: Low variance is also favorable as it indicates the model’s predictions are consistent across different sets of data.
Since the task does not demand excessive precision, the model's level of complexity is likely appropriate, effectively balancing the need for accuracy with the robustness of prediction across various conditions. This balance is often sought in practical applications where the goal is to make informed decisions without needing to dwell on small prediction errors.
3.	Decision Tree Model Interpretation:

a. Coefficient of Determination (R2 Score):
The R² value of 0.9983 indicates that the model explains 99.84% of the variance in the target variable, which is the apparent temperature. This suggests that the model's predictions are highly accurate and that it has captured the underlying relationship between the features and the target variable very well.

b. RMSE and its Percentage of the Target Variable's Average:
The RMSE of 0.2578 represents the model's average error in predicting the apparent temperature. To comment on the percentage of RMSE from the average of the target variable and the significance of rare outcomes, we would need to know the average value of the apparent temperature. However, if the RMSE is a small fraction of the target's average, this suggests good predictive performance. Rare outcomes with significant consequences would require a deeper analysis, potentially looking at the model's performance in specific ranges of the target variable.

c. Scatter Plots (Real vs. Predicted Values) and Slope Analysis:
The scatter plot shows actual vs. predicted values from the Decision Tree model. The points are closely aligned along the line of best fit (red line), indicating that the model predictions are very close to the actual values. The slope of this line is approximately 1, which means that there is a strong linear relationship between the predicted and actual values. This is indicative of a model with high accuracy.

d. Pearson’s Correlation between Real and Predicted:
Pearson's correlation coefficient is reported as 1.00, which is the maximum possible value, indicating a perfect positive linear relationship between the predicted and actual values. This suggests that the model has almost perfectly captured the variance in the data, but with a correlation of 1.00, it's also important to consider if there might be overfitting.

e. Learning Curves and Analysis of Bias/Variance:
The plot showing model complexity vs. error indicates how the mean squared error changes with different maximum depths of the decision tree. The sharp decline in both training and validation error as the depth increases suggests that increasing model complexity (i.e., allowing more depth) rapidly improves model performance initially.

However, as the depth increases further, the curves begin to level off, showing that beyond a certain point, increasing the complexity (depth) of the model does not lead to significant gains in performance on the validation set. This suggests that the model might benefit from a certain level of complexity but doesn't require an overly complex model to achieve low error rates. The point at which the validation error stops decreasing and stabilizes indicates the optimal model complexity.

The convergence of training and validation error at lower error rates suggests low bias and low variance, indicating a well-fitting model. If the training error continued to decrease with complexity while the validation error did not, it would suggest overfitting and high variance. Conversely, if both errors were high regardless of complexity, it would indicate underfitting and high bias. The trends in this plot suggest that the model achieves a good balance between bias and variance at the optimal complexity level.

4.	Gradient Boosting Regressor Model Interpretation:

a. Coefficient of Determination (R2 Score):
The R^2 value of 0.999 indicates that the model can explain 99.9% of the variance in the target variable. This suggests an excellent fit to the data, meaning the model predictions are almost perfectly aligned with the actual values.

b. RMSE and its Percentage of the Target Variable's Average:
The RMSE of 0.1626 is quite low, which indicates that the model's predictions are very close to the actual values. To interpret the RMSE in context, it would be necessary to compare it to the average value of the target variable. In general, a lower RMSE percentage indicates a highly accurate model. In cases where there are rare but crucial outcomes, it would be essential to analyze if the model predicts those accurately, as errors in such predictions could be more costly.

c. Scatter Plots (Real vs. Predicted Values) and Slope Analysis:
The scatter plot with a slope of approximately 1 (as indicated by the red line) demonstrates that the model's predictions are very much in line with the actual values. The points are tightly clustered around the line of best fit, further confirming the accuracy of the model.

d. Pearson’s Correlation between Real and Predicted:
The Pearson's correlation coefficient is 1.00, indicating a perfect positive linear relationship between the predicted and actual values. This reinforces the findings from the R^2 value and the scatter plot, showing that the predictions are highly correlated with the actual data.

e. Learning Curves and Analysis of Bias/Variance:
The learning curves show that both the training score and the cross-validation score converge to a low error as the number of training examples increases. The model displays low bias as the training score is low, and low variance as the cross-validation score is close to the training score and low. This means the model generalizes well to unseen data. As we move to more complex models (like increasing the number of estimators in the gradient boosting model), the error remains low, suggesting that the model complexity is well suited for the data and is not overfitting.

In conclusion, the Gradient Boosting Regressor model seems to be performing exceptionally well on this dataset, with nearly perfect prediction accuracy. This level of performance may indicate that the task is somewhat straightforward or that the model has effectively captured the patterns in the dataset. It would be advisable to evaluate model performance on an independent test set to confirm these results.

PART3:
a. Interpretation of feature importance for each model:
•	Linear Regression Feature Importance: Not applicable (Linear Regression doesn't directly provide feature importance as coefficients represent the relationship between independent and dependent variables.)
•	Neural Network Feature Importance: Not applicable (Similar to Linear Regression, Neural Networks operate differently, using weights in the layers rather than interpretable coefficients.)
•	Decision Tree Feature Importance: It shows that weather summary features like 'Summary_Foggy', 'Summary_Mostly Cloudy', and 'Summary_Overcast' hold substantial importance compared to other features, indicating their strong predictive power. The weather summary seems to heavily influence the prediction of the Apparent Temperature in this model.
•	Gradient Boosting Regressor Feature Importance: The importance scores again highlight the dominance of weather summary features in determining the Apparent Temperature, as observed in the Decision Tree model. These features significantly contribute to the model's predictive capability.
Interpretation:
Across Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting models, the dominance of weather summary features (like 'Summary_Foggy', 'Summary_Mostly Cloudy', etc.) suggests that these weather conditions strongly impact the Apparent Temperature prediction. This consistency implies a logical alignment between the significance of these weather summaries and their contribution to predicting the outcome.
However, in Linear Regression and Neural Network models, coefficients/weights aren't directly interpretable as feature importance. These models, despite their high predictive performance, don't provide explicit feature importance metrics like Decision Trees or Gradient Boosting models.
Therefore, while the weather summary features stand out as important across models that offer feature importance, the absence of such metrics in Linear Regression and Neural Networks hinders direct comparison regarding the significance of individual features.
In conclusion, the prominence of weather summary features aligns logically with the predictive performance observed in models that offer feature importance metrics. However, the absence of direct feature importance metrics in Linear Regression and Neural Networks limits a precise comparison of feature significance across all models.

b. Looking at a sample of the many rules extracted from the regression decision tree:
•	If Summary_Foggy <= 14.68: The model starts with a broad condition related to the "Foggy" summary. This could represent general weather conditions affected by fog.

•	If Summary_Foggy <= 10.00, 6.36, 5.05, 3.06: The tree progressively refines the conditions based on the "Foggy" summary. It creates thresholds indicating different levels or densities of fog.

•	If Summary_Mostly Cloudy > 5.25: A condition based on the presence of "Mostly Cloudy" conditions seems to be a branching point.

•	Predictions within specific thresholds: The subsequent rules seem to predict temperatures or conditions based on various combinations of weather summaries like "Mostly Cloudy," "Overcast," etc., combined with conditions related to fog, precipitation types, and thresholds related to those features.
From these rules:
•	Logic flow: The tree's logic seems to make sense. It's partitioning the data based on weather conditions. For instance, lower fog density correlates with higher temperatures while higher cloud cover may lower the predicted temperature.

•	Threshold-based decisions: The tree appears to divide the data based on specific thresholds of weather conditions, which aligns with common weather understanding. For example, predicting higher temperatures when fog density is lower and cloud cover is less.

•	Complexity and interpretability: The tree seems quite complex due to multiple conditions and branching points. It may be challenging to interpret the entire tree comprehensively, but each condition seems reasonable given typical weather patterns.

Overall, these rules reveal how the model navigates through different weather conditions and their impacts on predicting temperatures. They follow a logical sequence based on various weather summaries and align with general expectations of how weather conditions influence apparent temperature.
